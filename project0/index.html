            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the floral Directory. This is an attempt to provide the biological descriptions of different plant species from different genus. Here is a quick introduction to the history of classification</p>
                <p>The early history of development of botanical science is nothing but a history of development of plant taxonomy. The herbalists and agriculturists of ancient times gathered some knowledge about plants which was passed on from generation to generation.</p>
                <p>Theophrastus (372-278 BC), the Greek philosopher scientist placed this knowledge of plants on a scientific footing. In his “Enquiry into Plants” he dealt with the plants at large and attempted to arrange the plants in several groups. He is, therefore called the “Father of botany”.</p>
                <p>Pliny compiled a monumental work entitled “Historia Naturalis” where he incorporated all information about plants gathered up to that time and added much to the same collected by himself from his travels far and wide. Dioscorides was a contemporary of Pliny and like him travelled a lot and gathered information about medical plants.</p>
                <p>He compiled his famous book “Materia Medica” where he described about six hundred species of plants mentioning their local name and giving their medicinal properties. Along with descriptions he gave sketches which increased the value of the book very much and gained much popularity among the herbalists and plant-lovers in Europe.</p>
                <p>For a long period after this there was no contribution in the study of plants worth mentioning until Albert Magnus in the 13th century wrote his “De vegetabilis” where the difference in the stem structure of dicotyledons and monocotyledons was shown and the two groups were given the terms Tunicate and Corticate.</p>
                <p>Printed books on plants were available towards the close of the 15th century and a few German herbalists carried their enquiries about plants still farther ranking the study of Botany quite popular.</p>
                <p>Then came Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778), a Swedish naturalist who gave a new impetus to the study of plants. He was the professor of medicine and Botany in the Upsala University.</p>
                <p>The discovery of numerous plants from all over the world led him to think about bringing an order into the existing chaos and set himself in grouping and classifying all the plants known till his time. He proposed a system of classification which was published in his “Systema Naturae”(1735).</p>
                <p>Owing to the efforts of Linnaeus the study of Botanical science entered the modern age and Linnaeus is rightly called the “Father of the Modern Botany”.</p>

                          <p>The most important and the last of the natural systems of classification of seed plants was proposed by two British taxonomists George Bentham (1800-1884), a self-trained botanist and Joseph Dalton Hooker(1817-1911), the first director of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew, England.</p>
                          <p>They recorded precise description of most of the plants known at the time. Their monumental work which took a quarter of a century for completion was described in three volumes of genera Plantarum published in Latin during July 1862 and April 1883. Bentham and Hooker’s system of classification is still used and followed in several herbaria of the world. It is supposed to be the best system for the students to identify plants in the laboratory.</p>

              <h4>Development of the APG system</h4>
                <p>Three further versions of the APG classification were published in 2003, 2009, and 2016, each with multiple compilers and contributors. The most recent version, APG IV, has ten compilers and 15 contributors from six countries and is the result of a workshop hosted by Kew in September 2015. An online survey also provided useful background about the views of botanists and other users of the classification around the world.</p>
                <p>Each version of the APG has included a list of families and/or genera, of uncertain positions but by 2016 the list had shrunken to seven genera demonstrating the increase in knowledge as more plants have been sampled and more and mor DNA regions have been investigated. The number of higher-level groups formal and informal has also increased as a reflection of increasing confidence in the relationships of families to each other.</p>
